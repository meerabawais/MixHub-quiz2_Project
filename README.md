# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

### Project Description
The React Knowledge Hub is a multi-page web application built with React that serves as an interactive learning portal for React concepts. The project demonstrates core React skills including component-based architecture, routing, form handling, API integration, and state management.

Users can navigate through multiple pages such as a Home page, Courses, Programming Quotes, a React Quiz, and a Contact form â€” all connected using React Router. The app integrates a public API to fetch dynamic quotes, uses conditional rendering for the quiz feature, and validates user input in the contact form.

Key technical implementations include:

React Router DOM for smooth page transitions

useState and useEffect hooks for dynamic behavior and API interaction

Reusable components (e.g., CourseCard)

Form validation and feedback

A custom 404 Error page for undefined routes

Bonus features like localStorage support, and responsive design can optionally enhance the user experience.

This project is ideal for showcasing foundational React knowledge in a clean, modular, and user-friendly web application.
